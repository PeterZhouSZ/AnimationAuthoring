Controlling character via high-level control signal sequences is of high desire for game designers and storytelling tasks.
This work continues the recent work on <a href="https://github.com/sebastianstarke/AI4Animation">MANN </a>(Mode-Adaptive Neural Networks) for character control by the ability to carry out desired motion action types at a specified time or position using an interactive user-system. The system allows an offline control for different quadruped character movements, such as locomotion and stylizations thereof, sneaking, eating, and hydrating has been created.
Additionally, this work proposes a new dataset which aims to enhance synthetic motions when trained jointly with motion capture data. The approach is based on manipulating postures using inverse kinematics.
